## Kyverno Policies: Pod Security Admission
These policies are designed to codify Kubernetes Pod Security Admission.  A description
of these polices can be found
[here](https://kyverno.io/policies/?policytypes=Pod%2520Security%2520Admission).  Although
please note that the website documentation and policy-as-code defined here may
not be 100% synchronized 100% of the time(!)

** NOTE: ** This set of policies is not completely configured yet. Overlays
need to be developed!
